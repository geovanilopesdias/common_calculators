# A common calculator exercises
Abstract: in order to practice aloritmical and front-end skills, here it's presented some simple calculators in different technologies.

## Python
To pratice a little bit of Python, I've wrote a simple calculator with the Tkinter GUI library; as resources, I use the generic tutorial at [Python Tutorial](https://www.pythontutorial.net/tkinter/) as well as [NeuralLine tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzSCNjn4_RI), but none of them was implemented as they were; i.e., I used 'em only for debugging. Despite the fact that is already functional, future features that aim to apply are to exhbit scientific notation properly, without the "e+" notation nor overflowing the text widget field as well as some issues with overlapping operations.
As in all the scripts here listed, I've tried to simmulate, as fair as I could, the behaviour of a basic calculator with only the four algebric operations. For this reason, I put several tkinter Text instantiation status setters to avoid user could edit the number, but by the buttons. Indeed, it could be avoided by the use of label instances, but by the moment I wrote it, I couldn't find the proper methods to mainpulate their contents.
